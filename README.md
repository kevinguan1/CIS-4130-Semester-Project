CIS 4130 Big Data Technologies â€“ Semester Project

For this semester-long project, students will build a complete machine learning pipeline that incorporates big data technologies using a cloud infrastructure.  The project is split into 6 milestones that will be due throughout the semester.  The project must be original (e.g., not copied from a previous semester, competition or other source). However, code examples can be referenced (proper citations required).

To begin, create a Project Document in MS Word, Google Docs, etc. Create a cover page with CIS 4130, your name and e-mail address on it.  For each milestone, continue adding pages to this document throughout the semester.  For example, when turning in Milestone 3, include everything you wrote about in Milestones 1 and 2.

Note: When writing Python or PySpark code, include a comment section at the start of your file or Notebook that includes your name , CIS 4130 and the current date.
